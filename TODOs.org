#+startup:    content indent

* overview, design
because parsing the text file is tedious store in elisp format and have a
special mode to read it and show it in a buffer.

persistent file is project based or global

must have something like project based management mechanism to share 

such as tide.

when a buffer with icl mode on started up it will locate its project root which resolves
to global or project root. The project root is now a unique key to indentify the comment store

there is a global comment store which is a map of project  root -> project comment store

project comment store:
- comments: (file (line . comment)...)
- count: number of active buffers reading this store, when is is down to zero comments will be set to nil
- hook: this hook runs on store changed

** use case:
in project A, buffer a starts up and gets its project unique key as A,
From the global comment stores it gets it project comment store.
It is nil and the count is now set to 0.
With the count value it knows that it is the first one to access this store. 
It updates the count to one and initializes comments value for project.
Then it reads the comments from the store and show the comments in buffers.

Next a buffer b in project A starts up, and follows the same procedure but the
count is already greater than 0 so it means the project comment store is
already set up to go. So buffer b will just use the store and increase the count.

Some time later buffer b closes, it will decrease the count. It check the count
is still greater than 0

And finally buffer a is about to close. After decreasing the count to 0, that
means it is the last consumer of the store so it set the comment variable to
nil. Persist the data to a .ilc file

No memory leak this way.
** occur mode add marker info to text 
(get-text-property (point) 'occur-target)

* overlay structure
(overlay-put (make-overlay (point) (point) (current-buffer)) 'before-string "crap")

(overlay-put (make-overlay (point) (point) (current-buffer)) 'before-string "crap")
* problem with overlay moving
if only data structure is kept i.e line number and string
then when overlay is moved because of buffer change then we lose track of overlay

overlay should stick to the line it belongs to, eg symbol-overlay

in buffer 

we don't manage the ov list anymore sorting it keep it in order is a headache
just grab all the overlays in the buffer which has the tag then this is it.

how to extract and make/separate comment from indentation
the real string stored in 'virtual-comment tag
'before-string is to store the presentational text
* handle comment when its line moves is a big headache
there is a hook but it won't get triggered on some occasions so we won't handle
it. instead we provide functions to repair, copy and paste comment

yank, paste
* data layer
** function that grabs all the current overlays in buffer
** function that takes overlays list and produces comment data structure

read-from-string is a built-in function in ‘C source code’.

(read-from-string STRING &optional START END)

Read one Lisp expression which is represented as text by STRING.
Returns a cons: (OBJECT-READ . FINAL-STRING-INDEX).
FINAL-STRING-INDEX is an integer giving the position of the next
remaining character in STRING.  START and END optionally delimit
a substring of STRING from which to read;  they default to 0 and
(length STRING) respectively.  Negative values are counted from
the end of STRING.
** dump dat to file and load
it's a experiment
* repair should take into account of indentation beside point-at-bol
* unused sorting

how about org mode, outline mode lacks some commands

org mode is the best but unable to bind RET key when evil is on
so use outline mode instead

how come? was that because of async?
probably the async get runs on and buffers that it doesn't belong to
* DONE hook on save should only run when there is a time scheduled
timer flag can tell if the update should do or not
* DONE some persistent and store access should only work when mode is on

* DONE quit-window command for show 
make a show mode so its keybindings can be reset by evil
local-set-key applies everywhere to major mode anywhere, not recommended
it applies to outline mode, it will apply to org mode because org mode
is based on outline mode.

* TODO comments won't get saved when emacs closed or restarted
unconfirmed
* DONE comments scattered away or lost when buffer changed not by user's input but by revert-buffer
revert-buffer does it work like we open the file again?
it is seems to be the case

revert-buffer default option will reload all mode
but auto-revert-buffer won't. it keeps current modes

we need to handle after-revert-buffer-hook

but we can't tell hard and soft reload apart. Yes we set the flag
virtual-comment--is-initialized 
* TODO we can't do anything to undo
when undo applies to region having comments, we lose them

* TODO use notify to listen to change in evc file
+ [x] we only persist to project .evc when the last buffer closed

+ [x] must have a function to replace active data with data loaded from store
  - first call virtual-comment--reload-project once for the project
  - next each buffer calls virtual-comment--reload-data

+ [ ] get all buffers belonging to the project and run the init again in a
  with-current-buffer. This way alleviates the doubled pubsub between buffers
  and store

* INPROGRESS tie comment with line content
(point comment target)

and then before any update or a timer we run a function to reconcile any
mismatch between point and line-content then find the right line and move the ov
to it

(thing-at-point 'line t)

ov has virtual-comment virtual-comment-target

virtual-comment--ovs-to-cmts could be the place to reconcile the change

* TODO must decide where is the source of truth of 'virtual-comment-target
line at point or overlay
where do we assign the point value that's where we pick up the target
but point can be moved but target can be fixed on created
+ point can be moved freely
+ target should be fixed

+ [x] target can be changed by -paste
